# CodeLingo Backend Repository


## Cloning the repo into a new device

- Make sure you have install and setup git in your device. 
- You might need to get a new auth token from github to be allowed to push code into the repo **IF** you plan on pushing code from a terminal which is not VS code's integrated terminal. 
- To clone and make the repo ready for coding :

1. clone the repo into folder of your choice
```zsh
git clone "https://github.com/BunnyEncoder20/GitHub_CodeLingo_Backend.git" .
```
- The `.` in the end of the command clones the repo contents into the current dir. 

2. Install the dependencies
```zsh
npm i 
```
- `i` is a short form of writing install.

3. Ready to add code for the repo.
